        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through shared methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to an object's data and methods, ensuring controlled interaction and maintaining data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize an object's attributes when an instance of a class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, class methods and static methods are special types of methods that help in organizing code efficiently within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Methods (@classmethod)\n",
        "\n",
        " A class method operates on the class rather than an instance.\n",
        "\n",
        " It takes cls (class reference) as its first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        " Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        " Useful for modifying class-level attributes or creating instances in alternative ways.\n",

        "\n",
        " A static method does not require access to instance (self) or class (cls).\n",

        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Method overloading allows multiple versions of a method to be defined within the same class, each handling different numbers or types of parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What is method overriding in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that already exists in its parent class.\n",

        "13.  What is a property decorator in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A property decorator in Python (@property) is used to define getter methods, allowing controlled access to private attributes while maintaining the simplicity of attribute access.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Polymorphism is critical in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enhances code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability by allowing different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes.\n",

        "16.  What are the advantages of OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides several benefits that make software development more scalable, efficient, and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable.\n",
        "\n",
        " - In Python, class variables and instance variables are both attributes of a class, but they behave differently in terms of scope and access.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Class Variables\n",
        "\n",
        " Defined inside a class but outside any method.\n",
        "\n",
        " Shared by all instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        " Modified at the class level.\n",
        "\n",
        " Typically used for attributes that should be common across all objects.\n",

        " 2. Instance Variables\n",
        "  \n",
        " Defined inside the __init__() method.\n",
        "\n",
        " Specific to each instance.\n",
        "\n",
        " Modified at the instance level.\n",
        "\n",
        " Typically used for attributes that should be unique per object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, enabling it to acquire attributes and methods from multiple sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " - In Python, the __str__ and __repr__ methods are dunder (double underscore) methods that control how objects are represented as strings. They are used to provide meaningful string representations of objects when printed or inspected.\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. __str__ (User-Friendly Representation)\n",
        "\n",
        " Called when str(object) or print(object) is used.\n",
        "\n",
        " Returns a human-readable string representation.\n",
        "\n",
        " Meant for end users.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. __repr__ (Developer-Friendly Representation)\n",
        "\n",
        " Called when repr(object) or when inspecting the object in an interactive shell.\n",
        "\n",
        " Returns a formal, unambiguous string representation.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ideally, should return a valid Python expression to recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        " Used for debugging and logging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class within a child class. It helps in method resolution, avoiding redundant code, and maintaining proper inheritance structure.\n",
        "\n",
        " Key Benefits of super()\n",
        "\n",
        " Access Parent Methods – Enables a subclass to call methods from the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        " Avoid Code Duplication – Prevents rewriting parent class methods in child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        " Supports Multiple Inheritance – Works with Method Resolution Order (MRO) to determine which class’s method is invoked.\n",
        "\n",
        " Improves Maintainability – Ensures clean and efficient code structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor, called automatically when an object is deleted or goes out of scope. Its primary purpose is to release resources like file handles, database connections, or memory when an object is no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " - In Python, @staticmethod and @classmethod are both used to define methods inside a class, but they serve different purposes in terms of how they interact with the class and its instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. @staticmethod\n",
        "\n",
        " A static method does not take self (instance) or cls (class reference) as its first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        " It behaves like a regular function within a class but is included for logical grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        " Used when a method does not need access to instance or class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. @classmethod\n",
        "\n",
        " A class method takes cls as its first parameter, allowing it to access and modify class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        " Typically used when a method needs to interact with the class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        " - In Python, polymorphism works seamlessly with inheritance, allowing different child classes to define their own implementations of a shared method from a parent class. This helps in writing flexible and scalable code.\n",
        "\n",
        " Method Overriding: A child class provides its own implementation for a method inherited from a parent class.\n",
        "  \n",
        " Uniform Method Calls: Parent and child classes share the same method name, but the behavior differs based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        " Dynamic Dispatch: At runtime, Python determines which method to call based on the object’s actual type, not its reference type.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Method chaining in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a technique where multiple methods are called in a single line, one after another, on the same object. It improves code readability and avoids intermediate variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - The __call__ method in Python is a special dunder (double underscore) method that allows instances of a class to be called like functions. It makes objects callable, meaning you can use parentheses () directly on an instance to invoke specific behavior.\n",
